# 0x11. C - printf


This is a TEAM Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about What are macros and how to use them, What are the most common predefined macros & How to include guard in your header files in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Team Member: Lawrence Maduabuchi & Abdullahi Ngui.
* Date: April 21st 2023

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filengthame | Description |

| ` fill_hex_array.c` | Prints an unsigned number|
| ` Print_oarray.c` | Prints the value of a pointer variable|
| ` get_print_func.c` | Write a function calculate active flags.|

| ` print_buf.c` | A function that evaluates if a char is printable|
| ` print_chr.c` | A function that explicitly prints a string |
